# Network Security Portfolio

This repository contains incident reports and security assessments completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**. Each file analyzes real-world network threats and outlines structured responses using industry-standard tools and frameworks. Reports include packet analysis, protocol evaluation, hardening techniques, and strategic recommendations across network layers.

## About This Repository

As a Security Analyst in training, I’ve applied key cybersecurity principles—including traffic analysis, OS and network hardening, and protocol forensics—across a range of simulated scenarios. These reports demonstrate how I interpret logs, correlate threat activity, and propose actionable defense strategies using tools like `tcpdump`, Wireshark, and SIEM platforms. My work aligns with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** and documents activity across its five domains: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

This repo features:

- Risk assessment writeups
- Network protocol analysis
- Brute force and DDoS incident breakdowns
- Screenshots with traffic and log evidence
- OS and network hardening strategies
